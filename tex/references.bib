In particular, we study the number of linear regions, i.e. pieces, that a PWL function represented by a DNN can attain, both theoretically and empirically. We present (i) tighter upper and lower bounds for the maximum number of linear regions on rectifier networks, which are exact for inputs of dimension one; (ii) a first upper bound for multi-layer maxout networks; and (iii) a first method to perform exact enumeration or counting of the number of regions by modeling the DNN with a mixed-integer linear formulation. These bounds come from leveraging the dimension of the space defining each linear region. The results also indicate that a deep rectifier network can only have more linear regions than every shallow counterpart with same number of neurons if that number exceeds the dimension of the input.} }

abstract="Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are an important class of neural network characterized by weights and activations restricted to the set {\$}{\$}{\backslash}{\{}-1,+1{\backslash}{\}}{\$}{\$}. BNNs provide simple compact descriptions and as such have a wide range of applications in low-power devices. In this paper, we investigate a model-based approach to training BNNs using constraint programming (CP), mixed-integer programming (MIP), and CP/MIP hybrids. We formulate the training problem as finding a set of weights that correctly classify the training set instances while optimizing objective functions that have been proposed in the literature as proxies for generalizability. Our experimental results on the MNIST digit recognition dataset suggest that---when training data is limited---the BNNs found by our hybrid approach generalize better than those obtained from a state-of-the-art gradient descent method. More broadly, this work enables the analysis of neural network performance based on the availability of optimal solutions and optimality bounds.",
